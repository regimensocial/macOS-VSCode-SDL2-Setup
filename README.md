# macOS-VSCode-SDL2-Setup
Here is an example project for setting up SDL2 with Visual Studio Code on macOS.

1. [Install SDL2 first](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/mac/index.php)
2. [Install this next](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb)

Then you're fine, you can use this.
